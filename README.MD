# CMD: Windows Autoexec

`AUTOEXEC.BAT` was automatically executed when people used to run DOS.
We do not have that facility in Windows anymore, but this is a
stop-gap for it.

When running a toolchain without **Powershell** or **Bash**, it was
historically important to me to be able to libraries, tools and
utilities and tools for development.

I still use this setup on any **Windows** machine I work on. I was 
complaining about the lack of command line tooling available for
development on Windows, but I have started to work with the system
than against it. I maintain this Git repository periodically.

This is my **DotFiles** for Windows.

## Instructions

1. `git clone` or extract this repo into a directory called `CMD` in your home
directory. Such as `C:\Users\John\CMD`. This `README.MD` file should be
within it. Now just click and open the `AUTOEXEC.REG` registry entry.
It will add the registry entries in that file into your registry.

2. Open a new **Command Prompt** and now `AUTOEXEC.CMD` file will run
automatically.
