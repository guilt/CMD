# Windows-CMD-Autoexec 

`AUTOEXEC.BAT` was automatically executed when people used to run DOS. We do
not have that facility in Windows anymore, but this is a stop-gap for it.

When running a native toolchain without **Powershell** or **Bash**, it was
historically important to me to be able to access a ton of utilities, libraries
and tools for development.

Hence I created this for me, and I still use it on any **Windows** machine I work
on. Initially I was always complaining about the lack of tooling available for
development, but I slowly started to work with the system than against it. Hence
I maintain this periodically.

## Instructions

1. `git clone` or extract this repo into a directory called `CMD` in your home
directory. Such as `C:\Users\Karthik\CMD`. This `README.MD` file should be
within it. Now just click and open the `AUTOEXEC.REG` registry entry. It will
merge the contents into your registry.

2. Open a new **Command Prompt** and the `AUTOEXEC.CMD` file will run automatically.

3. ??

4. Profit!
